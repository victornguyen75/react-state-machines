# State Machines with the useReducer Hook

This project shows how you can use React's useReducer hook to illustrate finite state machines.

## Traffic Lights

This component shows how the useReducer hook can implement a [Moore finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine).

## Elevator

This component shows how the useReducer hook can implement a [Mealy finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine).
